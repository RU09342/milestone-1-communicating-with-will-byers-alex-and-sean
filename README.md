# Milestone 1: Stranger Things Light Wall
For the first milestone, you will be building "Addressable" RGB LEDs which can be connected in series with one another and can have patterns generated from them. You will need to utilize two development boards for this: the first is the one to control the RGB LED, and the second is to be a master for the whole LED Chain.

## Background Theory
In the following scene from Netflix's "Stranger Things", Will Byers stuck in a parallel dimension can only communicate to his mother by causing Christmas Lights to light up. The mother then strings up a set of lights like a Ouija Board so they can communicate back and forth.
